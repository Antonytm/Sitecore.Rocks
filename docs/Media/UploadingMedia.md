# Uploading Media
There are 3 ways to upload media:

* Drag an image file from your Windows Explorer to the Sitecore Explorer. When you hit an item in the Media Library, the mouse cursor becomes enabled. 
* Drag an image file from your Windows Explorer to an image field in the Content Editor. 
* Open the Media Library viewer (right-click a website in the Sitecore Explorer) and drag an image file from your Windows Explorer into it.
