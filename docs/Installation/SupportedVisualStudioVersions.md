# Supported Visual Studio Versions

Sitecore Rocks only works with Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013 (and maybe later versions).

Only Visual Studio Premium, Professional and Ultimate editions are supported. Visual Studio Express versions do not support plugins.

It is unknown if Sitecore Rocks is supported in WebMatrix and LightSwitch editions.

If you do not have access to either of these version, consider using Sitecore Rocks Windows which is a stand-along application that does not require Visual Studio.
